													<h2>Introduction to your data, for you</h2>
												</header>
												<p>Take a second to think of every website, online store, app, platform, or service you have given a phone number or email to. When was the last time you read the Terms of Services?

													If your answer is "never," don't worry - you're not alone. In fact, studies estimate that over 91% of people consent to Terms of Service without ever reading them. For younger people between the ages of 18 and 34, this number is even higher, at 97% [1]. This means that the vast majority of us are blindly agreeing to terms that we may not fully understand, potentially putting our online privacy and security at risk.
													
													Online privacy doesn't have to be complicated, intimidating, or burdensome. This guide is designed to provide you with a simple and straightforward understanding of what online privacy is, why it matters, and how you can take steps to protect yourself. You'll find practical recommendations and tools that can help you improve your privacy and regain control over your data.

											<h2>What is privacy?</h2>
										</header>

										<p>We all probably close and lock the door behind us when we leave home so no one comes into our home and rummages through our possessions, we all probably use headphones when we’re listening to an embarrassing song in public, and we all probably prefer if our doctor doesn’t live Tweet our medical appointments.

											Privacy is a concept that we regularly practice and value in our daily lives, and it has been explored and discussed for millenia by philosophers, legal scholars, sociologists, and technologists. However, online privacy differs slightly from the way we typically practice privacy in our offline lives. Online privacy is less about what we are doing and more about who we are and what we are doing. It's about protecting our digital identity and personal information from being accessed or misused by others on the internet [2].

											How has online privacy changed?
										</h2>
										<p>In recent years, there has been a significant shift in public perception around privacy practices of companies. With increasing public awareness around data breaches, online tracking, and targeted advertising, people are becoming more concerned about how their personal information is being collected, used, and shared. </p>

												<h2>2000-2004: Emergence of the Digital Age</h2>
												<p>In the early days of the internet, data privacy concerns were minimal. Companies, like Google, processed data collectively, rather than on an individual level. This meant that the information collected focused mainly on the search terms and clicked websites, rather than the users' browsing history, location data, or social media activity.</p>

												<p>As the number of internet users increased, companies began focusing more on individual data collection. Facebook and Google were among the first to realize that individually processed data could be used more effectively for advertising purposes. Smartphones and social media provided new opportunities for tracking and advertising. However, with these developments came the first instances of major data breaches.</p>

Between 2012 and 2017, there were over 130 data breaches, with the largest being Yahoo's breach that affected three billion accounts in 2013. In total, over 4.5 billion records were compromised in just five years, and up to one in three Americans experienced a data breach every year.</p>

												<p>Remember our earlier definitions of privacy? The right to be left alone and the right to have control over your data are at the cornerstone of what privacy is. This section includes information on your rights to your data as a California resident and steps to improve your privacy online.</p>
												</header>
												<h2>Knowing your rights</h2>
												<p>Privacy is considered a fundamental human right that is protected by various governments and international organizations. It allows individuals to have control over their personal information and to maintain their dignity and autonomy. Governments have implemented privacy laws and regulations to safeguard individuals from unlawful or unauthorized collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information.</p>

												<p>If you reside in California, regulation guarantees that you have enforceable privacy rights:</p>

												<ul>
												<li>The right to know about the personal information a business collects about you and how it is used and shared</li>
												<li>The right to delete personal information collected from you</li>
												<li>The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information</li>
												<li>The right to correct inaccurate personal information that a business has about you</li>
												<li>The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about you</li>

												<h2>Steps to take to improve your privacy</h2>
												<p>It may seem like there is no way to prevent companies and governments from using your data, and that privacy is a battle won and fought in court cases and litigation. That’s far from true! You can take steps to ensure that your data remains under your control. Here are some immediate ways to improve your privacy online.<br />

											</header>
											<section>
											<h2><b>Limit who tracks you</b></h2>
											<p>Knowing how companies track users online is important because it can have significant implications for one's privacy and security. Companies can collect data on users' browsing habits, search history, and personal information, which can be used for targeted advertising, identity theft, and other nefarious purposes.

												To pay attention to cookies, one can adjust their browser settings to control cookie usage, delete cookies regularly, and use private browsing modes. It's also important to be aware of the types of cookies that websites use, such as first-party and third-party cookies, and what they do.
												
												Using ad blockers can also be a useful tool for protecting one's privacy online. Ad blockers can prevent websites from displaying ads, which can often be a source of tracking cookies and other types of tracking scripts. However, it's important to note that some websites rely on ad revenue to function, so it's important to be selective when using ad blockers and whitelist websites that you trust.

										<p>This project was born out of an Information Visualization and Presentation course. This project was focused on educating and empowering individuals to take control of their online privacy through information visualization techniques. By visualizing data on privacy risks, common privacy violations, and privacy-enhancing tools, we aimed to raise awareness and provide actionable insights for individuals to make informed decisions about their online privacy. Through our project, we hope to promote privacy education and empower individuals to take control of their digital privacy.</p>
