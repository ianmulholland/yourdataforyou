											<h2>Introduction to your data, for you</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Take a second to think of every website, online store, app, platform, or service you have given a phone number or email to. When was the last time you read the Terms of Services?

											If your answer is "never," don't worry - you're not alone. In fact, studies estimate that over 91% of people consent to Terms of Service without ever reading them. For younger people between the ages of 18 and 34, this number is even higher, at 97% [1]. This means that the vast majority of us are blindly agreeing to terms that we may not fully understand, potentially putting our online privacy and security at risk.
											
											Online privacy doesn't have to be complicated, intimidating, or burdensome. This guide is designed to provide you with a simple and straightforward understanding of what online privacy is, why it matters, and how you can take steps to protect yourself. You'll find practical recommendations and tools that can help you improve your privacy and regain control over your data.

									<h2>What is privacy?</h2>
								</header>

								<p>We all probably close and lock the door behind us when we leave home so no one comes into our home and rummages through our possessions, we all probably use headphones when we’re listening to an embarrassing song in public, and we all probably prefer if our doctor doesn’t live Tweet our medical appointments.

									Privacy is a concept that we regularly practice and value in our daily lives, and it has been explored and discussed for millenia by philosophers, legal scholars, sociologists, and technologists. However, online privacy differs slightly from the way we typically practice privacy in our offline lives. Online privacy is less about what we are doing and more about who we are and what we are doing. It's about protecting our digital identity and personal information from being accessed or misused by others on the internet [2].

										  <h2>2000-2004: Emergence of the Digital Age</h2>
										  <p>In the early days of the internet, data privacy concerns were minimal. Companies, like Google, processed data collectively, rather than on an individual level. This meant that the information collected focused mainly on the search terms and clicked websites, rather than the users' browsing history, location data, or social media activity.

										  <h2>2005-2011: Data-Driven Advertising and Mobile Internet</h2>
										  <p>As the number of internet users increased, companies began focusing more on individual data collection. Facebook and Google were among the first to realize that individually processed data could be used more effectively for advertising purposes. Smartphones and social media provided new opportunities for tracking and advertising. However, with these developments came the first instances of major data breaches.</p>

Between 2012 and 2017, there were over 130 data breaches, with the largest being Yahoo's breach that affected three billion accounts in 2013. In total, over 4.5 billion records were compromised in just five years, and up to one in three Americans experienced a data breach every year.</p>

									<h2>Why is privacy important?</h2>
									<p>Take a second to think about what you would share with a random stranger. Would you share your medical records, bank statements, or your shopping history? Whenever we go online, we leave a digital footprint that can be used to identify our preferences, habits, and interests.  And that typical digital footprint is massive - we create and leave behind massive amounts of data each day. Each time we visit a website, watch a video, or swipe a screen, we transform our actions into data. The more information we share, the more companies or governments can aggregate data to represent you as an individual.</p>

										</header>
										<p>Anytime you agree to a Terms of Service, you agree to share information and data about yourself. What types of information are collected by the tools you use?</p>
										<h2>How do companies compare with each other?</h2>
										<p>Common Sense Privacy Evaluations is a comprehensive privacy evaluation system for websites, apps, and platforms used by children and families. The system employs a standardized evaluation process that assesses the privacy practices of websites, apps, and platforms across multiple categories, such as data collection, third-party sharing, and privacy policies. The privacy evaluations result in a score on a scale of 1-100, with higher scores indicating better privacy practices.</p>

										<h2>Knowing your rights</h2>
										<p>Privacy is considered a fundamental human right that is protected by various governments and international organizations. It allows individuals to have control over their personal information and to maintain their dignity and autonomy. Governments have implemented privacy laws and regulations to safeguard individuals from unlawful or unauthorized collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information.</p>

										<p>If you reside in California, regulation guarantees that you have enforceable privacy rights:</p>

										<ul>
										<li>The right to know about the personal information a business collects about you and how it is used and shared</li>
										<li>The right to delete personal information collected from you</li>
										<li>The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information</li>
										<li>The right to correct inaccurate personal information that a business has about you</li>
										<li>The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about you</li>
										<li>The right to non-discrimination for exercising your CCPA rights</li>
